 <li>
 	Go to <a href="https://github.ibm.com{{ site.baseurl }}/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">your market's Github project</a>. Open the <strong>projects</strong> folder, and then <strong>your specific project folder</strong>. 
 </li>
 <li>
 	Locate and select the <strong>index.md</strong> file.
</li>
<li>
	Click the trashcan icon in the top right corner. Then click the green <strong>Commit changes</strong> button in the bottom left to confirm the deletion.
	<ul>
		<li>
			Now the project page won't be able to be found by the browser, and the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}#offerings" target="_blank"><strong>offerings</strong></a> section of the parent market page will no longer list your project.
		</li>
	</ul>
 </li>
  <li>
 	Do the same for all remaining files within your specific project folder, to get rid of the extra code files.
	<ul>
		<li>
			There's no way to delete an entire folder in one fell swoop with Github's online version, so you'll have to navigate into the subfolders (<strong>project-includes</strong> and <strong>project-sections</strong>) and manually delete each file. When a folder is empty, it will automatically be deleted from Github.
