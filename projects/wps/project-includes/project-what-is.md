#### What is {{ page.title }}? {#whatis}

Watson for Patient Safety enables pharmaceutical companies to more efficiently react to problems that occur when patients use their products. In future releases, WPS will be able to help identify larger problem areas and possibly predict where new problems could arise.

The purpose of this page is to collect and share the ongoing design work and design outcomes for WPS. This page will be updated as the design work and team evolve. We are part of the [Life Sciences](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Watson-Health/life-sciences/){:target="_blank"} pillar of Watson Health.
